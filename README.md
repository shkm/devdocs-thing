# DevDocs Thing
Welcome to the creatively named DevDocs Thing.

This is a simple wrapper around the wonderful [DevDocs](`https://devdocs.io`) service, providing a global keyboard shortcut and dedicated window for access.

This project is currently in a hacky alpha state:
- The global shortcut is hardcoded (Alt+Space)
- There are no icons
- It doesn't do a great deal 

It does just about enough to be useful to me, but I intend to make this a bit more useful for others in the future.

## Development

```
npm install
npm run start
```
